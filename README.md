# Password Strength Analyzer
## Overview
The Password Strength Analyzer is a robust, Python-based application meticulously crafted to evaluate the security robustness of passwords by leveraging entropy-based scoring and adhering to established cybersecurity best practices, including guidelines from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). This project features both a command-line interface (password_analyzer.py) and an aesthetically enhanced graphical user interface (password_analyzer_gui.py) developed using Tkinter. Designed as a practical demonstration of programming proficiency in Python, GUI development with Tkinter, and foundational cybersecurity principles, this tool serves as an exemplary portfolio piece for aspiring software developers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and students aiming to showcase technical skills in a professional or academic setting.
Features

Dual Interfaces: Offers both a command-line interface and a GUI, providing users with flexible access methods tailored to their preferences or technical expertise.
Comprehensive Strength Analysis: Assesses password security with a detailed 0–100 score, evaluating criteria such as minimum length (8 characters), inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, ensuring a thorough security check.
Entropy Calculation: Quantifies password randomness in bits (e.g., 53.46 bits for a strong password), offering a scientific measure of unpredictability critical for security assessments.
Common Password Detection: Cross-references passwords against a curated database of over 1,000 common passwords (common_passwords.txt) to identify and flag weak or frequently used choices.
Secure Password Generation: Generates random, cryptographically strong passwords (default 12 characters, incorporating mixed types) with an innovative "Show/Hide Password" toggle feature in the GUI for enhanced usability and security.
Detailed User Feedback: Delivers granular feedback on password components (e.g., "Length is good!" or "Missing special character") alongside actionable improvement suggestions to guide users toward stronger passwords.
Robust Error Handling: Implements sophisticated error management for file access issues, empty inputs, and non-ASCII characters, ensuring reliability across diverse use cases.
Modern GUI Design: Features a visually appealing interface with custom color schemes, optimized fonts, and interactive elements like the toggle button, elevating the user experience to a professional standard.

Installation

Prerequisites: Install Python 3.12 or a later version from the official site (python.org).
Repository Cloning:git clone https://github.com/Dipanshu6265/PasswordStrengthAnalyzer.git
cd PasswordStrengthAnalyzer


Dependencies: No external libraries are required; Tkinter is bundled with the standard Python installation, making setup seamless.

Usage
Command-Line Example

Execution:python password_analyzer.py


Interactive Menu:=== Password Strength Analyzer ===
1. Analyze a password
2. Generate a secure password
3. Quit
Enter your choice (1-3): 1
Enter your password: P@ssw0rd!


Sample Output:Results:
Length is good! (8+ characters)
Contains uppercase letter: Good
Contains lowercase letter: Good
Contains digit: Good
Contains special character: Good
Password Strength Score: 80/100
Password Entropy: 53.46 bits
Password Strength: Strong
Suggested Improvement: Consider increasing length for maximum security.



GUI Example

Execution:python password_analyzer_gui.py


Interface Actions:
Input a password and click "Analyze" to receive a comprehensive report.
Click "Generate Password" to produce a secure, random password.
Utilize the "Show/Hide Password" toggle to securely view or conceal the generated password.
Click "Quit" to gracefully exit the application.


Interface Highlights: The GUI boasts a modern layout with color-coded feedback (e.g., green for "Good," red for "Weak"), styled buttons, and a responsive design, optimized for both novice and advanced users.

Testing
The project is accompanied by an extensive test suite comprising 9 unit test files (e.g., test_entropy.py, test_tkinter.py, test_ui.py) developed using Python’s built-in unittest framework. These tests validate core functionalities, including password analysis algorithms, GUI component behavior, and error-handling mechanisms. To run tests individually:
python test_entropy.py

Or collectively (if organized in a tests/ directory):
python -m unittest discover -s tests

This testing infrastructure ensures code reliability and serves as a learning resource for best practices in software testing.
Project Structure

password_analyzer.py: Core logic for command-line password analysis.
password_analyzer_gui.py: GUI implementation with Tkinter.
common_passwords.txt: Database of common passwords for validation.
test_*.py: Unit tests for various components (e.g., test_entropy.py for entropy calculations).
README.md: This documentation file.
screenshot.png: Visual representation of the GUI (see below).

Future Improvements

Customizable Password Generation: Enable users to define password length, character sets, and complexity requirements.
Enhanced Entropy Analysis: Integrate advanced character set profiling and adaptive entropy models for greater accuracy.
Password History Feature: Implement a secure logging system (with user opt-in) to track analyzed passwords for review.
Advanced UI Features: Add customizable themes, progress indicators during analysis, and multi-language support to broaden accessibility.
